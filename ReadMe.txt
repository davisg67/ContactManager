A basic contact management web application developed around C# and the MVC arcitecture. 
This was a practice project while learning C# and MVC. it came from a great course I took 
online at Udemy, https://www.udemy.com/aspnet-mvc-quick-start/, by Brian Gorman. I highly 
recommend this course for a quick start into MVC programming.
